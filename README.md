* About Me
I'm Allea Trillana, a 19-year-old college student with a deep passion for arts and a budding interest in coding. My creative journey includes traditional and digital art forms, where I express my ideas through drawing, painting, and graphic design. Alongside my artistic pursuits, I've developed a foundational understanding of coding, particularly in Python, HTML, and CSS. This unique combination allows me to blend creativity with technology, exploring new and creative ways to express myself. I'm eager to continue expanding my skills and applying them in projects that require both artistic and technical expertise.

* Skills
- **Coding**: I've learned the basics of Python, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy creating simple websites and writing small programs to bring my ideas to life.
- **Portraits (Sketch)**: Drawing portraits is one of my favorite activities. I strive to capture people's expressions and personalities using techniques that bring their features to life on paper.
- **Paintings**: I work with various painting mediums, including acrylics, color pencils, and watercolors. My paintings often reflect my appreciation for color, texture, and composition, and I enjoy experimenting with different styles and techniques.
